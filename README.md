# TD Vault
Hi! My name is Jonah Newton, and welcome to TD Vault. I like to help people create cool stuff.

Over my time as a Pipeline Technical Director in the 3D Animation & Visual Effects post-production industry, I have self-learned a LOT, and want to use this space to share some of what I have learnt that isn't already documented clearly online. I hope these guides help you with your animation and post-production programming projects.
