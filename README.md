# Notes on Programming for Animation & VFX
Hi! My name is Jonah. I write software to help people create cool stuff. 
Welcome to TD Vault.

I am currently a Pipeline Technical Director at [Flying Bark Productions](https://www.flyingbark.com.au), and previously the [UTS Animal Logic Academy](https://animallogicacademy.uts.edu.au/). Over my time as a Pipeline TD in the 3D Animation & Visual Effects post-production industry, I have self-learned a LOT, and want to use this space to share some of what I have learnt that isn't already documented clearly online. From programming for animation and VFX DCCs in Python & C++ to hidden environment variables/CLI tips, I hope these guides help you with your animation and VFX programming projects.

Many of these pages will link to folders/files in the [TDVault GitHub repo](https://github.com/jonahjnewton/TDVault) (which runs this website). This repo contains scripts and examples for the topics on this site.
