Hi! My name is Jonah Newton, and welcome to TDVault. I like to help people create cool stuff.

Over my time as a Pipeline Technical Director in the 3D Animation & Visual Effects post-production industry, I have self-learned a LOT, and want to use this space to share some of what I have learnt. I hope you find something on this site that helps you become more knowledgable on programming for animation and post-production.
